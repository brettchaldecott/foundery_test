# Foundery Example project

This project provides an example Roman Numeral Parser and simple document parser.

## Roman Numeral Parser
The parser uses a reverse parse process and recursion in order to support more complex roman numeral structures. This is a bit beyound what is required, but I got intrigued by the process.

## Document Parser
The document parser, parses line by line through the document and constructs the appropriate sub parsers.

## Build
mvn install

## Run
java -jar target/Galaxy-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ./test
